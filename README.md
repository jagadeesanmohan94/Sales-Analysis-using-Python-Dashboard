👔  Summary

Performance & Seasonality
Annual revenue totals 34.47M with a monthly average of 2.87M. Sales exhibit strong Q4 seasonality—Q4 contributes 33.5%, with December the top month (4.61M). The sharp October surge (+78% MoM) signals an effective campaign/launch window, and mid‑year softness (Jun–Sep) is the main headwind.
Product Mix
Bundles anchored on charging cables dominate (~64% of bundle share), confirming accessories as key conversion drivers. Across individual products, cables & batteries deliver high‑volume throughput, while devices/appliances provide ASP lift and brand halo.
Geography
Sales are concentrated on the West Coast (55%), led by San Francisco (24%). Extending SF best practices to LA/Seattle, while tailoring urban East Coast offers (NYC/Boston), will improve regional balance and service levels.
Strategic Recommendations

Q4 Playbook: lock inventory and promo calendar for Oct–Dec; replicate the October motion (bundles + expedited shipping + gift messaging).
Attach‑Rate & Bundles: scale accessory bundles and checkout add‑ons; aim for +5–8 pts attach‑rate uplift quarter‑over‑quarter.
Mid‑Year Smoothing: run July–August price fences (multi‑pack deals, subscription re‑fill for batteries/cables) to counter seasonal dips.
Geo Expansion: prioritize West Coast fulfillment capacity; run localized ads in LA & Seattle; craft commuter‑friendly bundles for NYC/Boston.
Merchandising Mix: use high‑ASP anchors (MacBook/iPhone/appliances) to draw traffic; recover margin via premium accessory upsells.
KPIs to Track: monthly AOV and attach rate, geo conversion, stock‑outs / fill rate in Q4, and promo ROI around October.

Headphone bundles (~24%) are secondary but meaningful; scope for cross‑selling with charging cables.

Actions

Keep bundle pricing sharp for cables; introduce tiered bundles (cable + case + screen protector) to lift AOV.
Test add‑on prompts (“Complete your setup”) for headphone bundles on checkout pages.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d80f98a-12a1-485a-9794-3c048f2b88d5)


Pattern (all five accessories show synchronized seasonality):

Build to April peak, dip mid‑year (Jul–Aug), spike in Oct, pull back in Nov, and strongest in Dec.
Lightning & USB‑C cables lead slightly over batteries/headphones in peak months, suggesting gift season + device refresh cycles.

Actions

Forward-buy inventory for cables by end‑Q3; set October promos (bundle + free shipping) to catch the early peak and ride through Dec.
Use price fences (multi‑pack discounts on batteries) to smooth mid‑year dips.

What the chart shows (directionally):

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5acaf678-0055-4cda-b0e9-3de0992b188e)

Highest order counts: AAA and AA battery 4‑packs, then Lightning Charging Cable, and Wired Headphones.
High ASP spike: MacBook Pro Laptop; iPhone and large appliances (e.g., LG Washer/Dryer) also lift ASP.
Accessories = low ASP / high volume; devices/appliances = high ASP / lower volume.

Actions

Attach‑rate programs: push cables/batteries add‑ons on device pages (target attach rates 35–45%).
Portfolio “good–better–best” pricing: keep entry accessory SKUs competitive; offer premium options with margin‑rich upsells (braided cables, noise‑isolating headphones).
Margin mix: use high‑ASP items to anchor promotions; recover margin via bundled accessories.
